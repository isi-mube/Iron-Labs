## About the Dataset

## Improvements from previous project
* **OS**: We got used it more often.
* **Functions**: We stored them in a different folder to later import them as a library. Gr√†cies, Camille :)
* **IDE**: JupyterLabs over JupyterNotebook. Personal preference, trying different IDE.
* **Documentation**: # instead of color-boxes.
