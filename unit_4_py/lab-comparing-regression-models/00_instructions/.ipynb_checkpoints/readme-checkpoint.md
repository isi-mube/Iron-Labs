# Lab | Basic Data Cleaning and EDA

For this lab, we will be using the dataset in the Customer Analysis Business Case. This dataset can be found in the `files_for_lab` folder.

## Context

An auto insurance company has collected some data about its customers including their _demographics_, _education_, _employment_, _policy details_, _vehicle information_ on which insurance policy is and _claim amounts_. You will help the senior management with some business questions that should help them to better understand their customers, improve their services and improve profitability.

**Some business Objectives for the case study could be**:

- Retain customers,
- Analyze relevant customer data,
- Develop focused customer retention programs.

Based on the analysis, take targeted actions to increase profitable customer response, retention, and growth.

### Instructions

1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Load the `we_fn_use_c_marketing_customer_value_analysis.csv` into the variable `customer_df` (i.e. `customer_df = pd.readcsv("")`)
3. First, look at its main features (`head`, `shape`, `info`).
4. Rename the columns so they follow the PE8 (snake case).
5. Fix the data types of any other column/columns as you might see necessary. Note that sometimes there are some features you might want to use as categorical, but they are read as numerical by python (and vice versa). For eg., if there's a column with year values like 2020, 2021, 2022, etc., this column might be read as numerical by python, but you would want to use that column as categorical data. **Hint**: One thing you can try is to change date column to datetime format.
6. Plot a correlation matrix, and comment on what you observe.
7. Plot every continuous variable. Comment what you can see in the plots.
8. Do the same with the categorical variables (be careful, you may need to change the plot type to one better suited for continuous data!). Comment what you can see in the plots. 
You should also delete the column `customer_id` before you can try to use a for loop on all the categorical columns. Discuss why is deleting the column `customer_id` required. **Hint**: Use bar plots to plot categorical data, with each unique category in the column on the x-axis and an appropriate measure on the y-axis.
9. Look for outliers in the continuous variables. (**Hint**: Thereâ€™s a good plot to do that!). In case you find outliers, comment on what you will do with them.
10. Check all columns for *NaN* values. Decide what (if anything) you will need to do with them.
