# Lab | Random Forests

For this lab, you will be using the CSV files provided in the `files_for_lab` folder.

### Instructions

- Apply the Random Forests algorithm but this time only by upscaling the data using `SMOTE`.
- Note that since `SMOTE` works on numerical data only, we will first encode the categorical variables in this case.
