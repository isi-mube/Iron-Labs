# Lab | Feature engineering

- In this lab, you will use `learningSet.csv` file which you have already cloned in the previous activities. 

### Instructions

Here we will work on cleaning some of the other columns in the dataset using the techniques that we used before in the lessons.

- Check for null values in the numerical columns.
- Use appropriate methods to clean the columns `GEOCODE2`, `WEALTH1`, `ADI`, `DMA`,and `MSA`.
- Use appropriate EDA technique where ever necessary.
