# Lab | Inferential statistics


### Instructions

1. It is assumed that the mean systolic blood pressure is `Î¼ = 120 mm Hg`. In the Honolulu Heart Study, a sample of `n = 100` people had an average systolic blood pressure of 130.1 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 21.21 mm Hg. Is the group significantly different (with respect to systolic blood pressure!) from the regular population?

   - Set up the hypothesis test.
   - Write down all the steps followed for setting up the test.
   - Calculate the test statistic by hand and also code it in Python. It should be 4.76190. We will take a look at how to make decisions based on this calculated value.

2. If you finished the previous question, please go through the code for `principal_component_analysis_example` provided in the `files_for_lab` folder .
