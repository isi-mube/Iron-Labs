# Lab | Customer Analysis Round 2

For this lab, we will be using the `marketing_customer_analysis.csv` file that you can find in the `files_for_lab` folder. Check out the `files_for_lab/about.md` to get more information if you are using the Online Excel.

**Note**: For the next labs we will be using the same data file. Please save the code, so that you can re-use it later in the labs following this lab.

### Dealing with the data

1. Show the dataframe shape.
2. Standardize header names.
3. Which columns are numerical?
4. Which columns are categorical?
5. Check and deal with `NaN` values.
6. Datetime format - Extract the months from the dataset and store in a separate column. Then filter the data to show only the information for the first quarter , ie. January, February and March. _Hint_: If data from March does not exist, consider only January and February.
7. BONUS: Put all the previously mentioned data transformations into a function.
