# 1.04 Activity 1

Refer to the file `files_for_activities/file1.csv` for this exercise.

1. Load data (`file1.csv`) in a new Jupyter notebook.
2. Write the code to clean the columns 'ic4' and 'ic5' of null values in the dataframe.
3. Use the `head()` to check the new dataframe.

### Debate

1. Is it better to fill null values with the mean or with the median?
2. Can we drop all rows with null values?
