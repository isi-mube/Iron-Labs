# 1.04 Activity 2

Refer to the file `files_for_activities/merged_clean_ver1.csv` for this exercise.

1. Import the data from `merged_clean_ver1.csv` as a dataframe. There would be a column with the sequence of numbers (to the left of column _id_). Drop that column(s).

2. Check the column _state_ for null values. Replace those null values with the state that is represented largest number of times in that column

3. Lambda Expression:

   - Create a simple lambda expression to add three numbers. Take those three numbers as input from the user. (_Since you will accept only numbers as valid inputs, check this [example](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-can-we-read-inputs-as-integers-in-Python) to see how to do it._)
   - Define a list as `lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10]`. Write a lambda expression to find the cube of a number. Use that lambda expression to find the cube of every number in the list. Define a _list comprehension_ for this question.
