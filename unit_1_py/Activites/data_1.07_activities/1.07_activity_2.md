# 1.07 Activity 2

Keep using the same file.

1. Repeat the process(log transformation) for the column IC3. Define the function again yourself.
2. Remove the tails of the transformed column to make it closer to the normal distribution. This time change the factor from 1.5 to 3 when calculating the upper limit and the lower limit. Check the distribution plot. Does it remove the tails effectively? If not change the factor back to 1.5 and see the results.
