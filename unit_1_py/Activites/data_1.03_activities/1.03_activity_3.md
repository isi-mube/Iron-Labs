# 1.03 Activity 3

(_Keep using the same notebook you used in the activity 1._)

1. Filter the results for women, and store the results in another DataFrame `filtered2`.
2. Check the first 10 rows of the DataFrame using the `head()` function.
3. Reset the index of `filtered2` with and without using the parameter `drop=True` and check the difference in the results.
4. Show the rows from index number 100 to 200.
5. Use `iloc` to get the first 100 rows and columns with indexes 2,3,4,5.
