# Tasks List

Here are some of the tasks you need to perform:

### 1.02 Activity 1

- Aggregate data into one excel sheet
- Standardizing header names
- Deleting and rearranging columns – Keep "Customer" column as the first column in the file and as it is only a unique identifier for each row of data
- Working with data types – Check the data types of all the columns and fix the incorrect ones (for ex. customer lifetime value and number of complaints )
- Filtering data and Correcting typos – Filter the data in state and gender column to standardize the texts in those columns
- Removing duplicates
- Conditional Formatting
- Replacing null values – Replace missing values with means of the column (for numerical columns)

### 1.02 Activity 2

- Bucketing the data - Write a function to replace column "State" to different zones. California as West Region, Oregon as North West, and Washington as East, and Arizona and Nevada as Central
- Standardizing the data – Use string functions to standardize the text data (lower case)
- Use the lookup table to add columns sales channel and vehicle size to the original data
