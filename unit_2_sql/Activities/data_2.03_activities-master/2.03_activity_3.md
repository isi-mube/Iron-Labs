# 2.03 Activity 3

#### Questions and queries

1. Null or empty values are usually a problem. Think about why those null values can appear and think of ways of dealing with them.
2. Check for _transactions_ with null or empty values for the column `amount`.
3. Count how many _transactions_ have empty and non-empty `k_symbol` (in one query).
