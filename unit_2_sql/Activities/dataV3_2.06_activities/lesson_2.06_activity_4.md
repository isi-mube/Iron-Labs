1. Check if referential integrity is followed in the following tables?

2. Now use the `bank` database to make the following changes:

      a. Use the insert command to create a new entry in the `loan` table with the following values (8000,8000000,930705,96396,12,8033.0,'C'). Here each element corresponds to the values in columns in the table (in the order the columns appear in the table). This might raise an error. Why is that?

      b. Use the delete command to delete an entry from the table account where the `account_id` is `11382`. Does this result in an error? If it does, then why?
      
      
 
3. Create the rest of the tables in the `bank` database (at least the `client` and the `card` tables)

4. Design and create a new database structure. Justify your changes.
      - Some ideas include renaming columns to ones that make more sense and, for eg., in the table `district`, adding foreign keys wherever necessary.
