# 2.01 Activity 3

Refer to the bank database case study using `files_for_activities/case_study_bank.md` file.

- Brainstorm on some questions that could be answered throught the information available in the database. You can check what kind of information can you extract from different tables provided in the database. To give you a couple of simple examples :
    - Using the accounts table, you can find how many customers are there with the bank
    - Using the cards table, you can find what are the different types of card services that are provided by the bank for eg classic, junior and gold
    
Note at this point we are only interested on the insights that could be found using the information, and not about how you will write the SQL queries to get those results.
